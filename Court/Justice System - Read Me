You are advised this BEFORE you start to implement methods.


CourtHouse:

1) Notice you have pointers array to judges - do not forget to delete each judge AND the array itself
2) The court house can be referred as array of court rooms, we declared one as const for const references as you can see below:
    CourtRoom& operator[](int index);
	const CourtRoom& operator[](int index) const;
3) When you add a Judge to the court house make sure to update the judge with "setWorkPlace()" that judge inherits from CourtWorker

CourtRoom:

1) The court room can be referred as array of trials, we declared one as const for const references.
2) When you add a trial to a court room, you must update the Trial courtroom attribute as well inside the "addTrial()" function
3) Every time you add a trial (addTrial() method) you need to check that the room isn't taken already in that time (use getStartTime() and getEndTime())
by "isTaken()" method, if it is throw an exception

4) Make sure to update the trial array size in each successful addition


Trial:

1)The Trial constructor must use the "CourtRoom.addTrial()" function so there will be no contridictions
2)The Parties should be updated about the trial they are a part of
3)Same for the Judge, you should also check that the judge isn't busy with "isBusy()" method otherwise an exception should be thrown
4)Notice that by default there's no jury in the trial, if you like to add one use set Jury, also use hasJury() to determine whether or not
there is a Jury assigned to the Trial, it is recommended to use it before "getJury()" call

Party:

1) In the Party Constructor you should use the PartyLawyer:: setParty() method to keep them both up to date

Judge:

1) In the Judge Constructor make sure that the court house is being updated about the new judge
